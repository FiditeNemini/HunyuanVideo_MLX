# PyTorch MPS optimization for Apple Silicon
# High watermark ratio controls the maximum memory allocation (0.6 recommended for stability)
PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.6

# Low watermark ratio sets the threshold for garbage collection (should be lower than high ratio)
PYTORCH_MPS_LOW_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.5

# Memory allocator policy to enable garbage collection
PYTORCH_MPS_ALLOCATOR_POLICY=garbage_collection

# Additional memory optimization settings
# Enable guard mode for better memory management
MPS_USE_GUARD_MODE=1
# Enable memory guard to prevent memory leaks
MPS_ENABLE_MEMORY_GUARD=1

# Note: These settings are optimized for M-series Macs with 32GB RAM
# For M3 Max/Ultra with 64GB+ RAM, you can increase HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO to 0.8
