# PyTorch MPS optimization for Apple Silicon
# Conservative memory settings to prevent OOM during model loading
PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.4
PYTORCH_MPS_LOW_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.3
PYTORCH_MPS_ALLOCATOR_POLICY=garbage_collection

# Additional memory optimization settings
MPS_USE_GUARD_MODE=1
MPS_ENABLE_MEMORY_GUARD=1

# Force synchronous memory operations
PYTORCH_MPS_SYNC_OPERATIONS=1

# Enable aggressive garbage collection
PYTORCH_MPS_AGGRESSIVE_MEMORY_CLEANUP=1

# Note: These are very conservative settings to ensure stable model loading
# After successful loading, you can adjust HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO up to:
# - 0.6 for 32GB RAM
# - 0.8 for 64GB+ RAM
