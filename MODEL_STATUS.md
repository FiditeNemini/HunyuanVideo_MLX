## Important Notice

The HunyuanVideo project is currently in its initial release phase. While the main transformer model is available, we are waiting for the release of the VAE and text encoder models. We are actively monitoring the following sources for updates:

1. Official Sources:
- [HunyuanVideo Repository](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo)
- [Hugging Face Model Page](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo)
- [Project Website](https://aivideo.hunyuan.tencent.com)

2. Alternative Options:
- We are investigating compatible VAE models
- Looking into text encoder alternatives
- Monitoring community solutions

## Next Steps

1. For Users:
- The main transformer model is downloaded and ready
- Watch the official repository for VAE and text encoder releases
- Join the community discussions for updates

2. For Development:
- We can proceed with setup and infrastructure
- Test system compatibility with available components
- Prepare for full integration when all models are available

## Updates

We will update this document as soon as:
1. The VAE model becomes available
2. The text encoder model becomes available
3. Alternative solutions are verified

## Temporary Limitations

Without the VAE and text encoder models:
- Full video generation is not possible yet
- System testing is limited to transformer model operations
- Memory requirements might change when full system is available

## Stay Updated

To stay informed about model releases:
1. Watch the [HunyuanVideo Repository](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo)
2. Check the [Hugging Face Model Page](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo)
3. Monitor the [Issues Page](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo/issues) for community updates

## Need Help?

If you have access to working VAE or text encoder models:
1. Verify they are compatible with HunyuanVideo
2. Share information through official channels
3. Help update documentation for the community

We appreciate your patience as we work to provide a complete solution.
